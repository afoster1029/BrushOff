Drawing app that provides users with a prompt to draw something.

Need to install several modules via the terminal.
- Install npm
- Install expo with npm
- Install yarn (however you like)
- With yarn, add expo-pixie and react-navigation.
- Run command: "npm install --save react-native-timer"
- Run command: "npm install react-native-filesystem --save"
- Run command: "react-native link react-native-filesystem"
- Run command: "npm install -g react-native-cli" to install the cli (enter sudo
  before npm if having system access troubles)
